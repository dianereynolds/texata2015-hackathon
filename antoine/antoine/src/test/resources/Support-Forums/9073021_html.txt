Hi folks! A simple problem ( I hope so..) I've configured Cisco 2600, IOS version 12.1(6) with IP addresses for the 3 interfaces (e0,e1 and s0. When I enter the router rip command. The message displayed in "IP routing not enabled". Anyhelp would be appreciated. I have this problem too. 0 votes

Try entering "ip routing" in your config to see of that makes a difference.

Remember Without enabling (ip routing) your routing protocol will not work. Can I ask why are you using RIP? or RIP2 ??
