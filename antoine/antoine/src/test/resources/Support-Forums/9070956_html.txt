Which layer of the OSI does this work at? I assume that as switches are layer 2 devices, STP must work at layer 2 as well? I have this problem too. 0 votes

It works on Layer 2 as you know that switch is Layer 2 device. To know how it work you can see the below flash tutorial. http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/473/spanning_tree1.swf
