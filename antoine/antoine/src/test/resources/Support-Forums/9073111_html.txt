The "SS" is a cable part number usually infers a "smart serial" connection. This is the miniature connector found on the newer interfaces, such as a WIC-2T. I suspect that the other part number is the older DB-60 version. You can always do a search on CCO for "cable part numbers" or similar for detail.
