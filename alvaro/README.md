# texata-finals

My submission for Texata final round. The main file to read to understand the my proposal is the *report* notebook. References to the purpose of the rest of files is also provided there.

Since some datasets used here are either CISCO property or too large to upload to Git, you will find that the corpus related functions will not work. Similarly, trained models were too large to upload and so are not included. Therefore, the code is only uploaded as a showcase of the solution.
